A dictionary of words is supplied in dictionary.txt
If you want words to not be used in the word ladder add them to the notAllowed.txt file and input the file name when promted.

The program requires the user enters a list of words to use.
The user then inputs the start word and the end word they want to get to.
Shortest path allows the user to choose to find the shortest path or to continue normally.
The shortest path makes sure only optimal words are chosen to minimise the number of steps between words.
